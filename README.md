Spam emails are unsolicited messages that can clutter inboxes, waste time, and often contain phishing attempts, advertisements, or malicious links. To address these challenges, the Spam Email Classifier project develops an automated system that can accurately identify and filter spam emails using machine learning techniques.

The system employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze the textual content of emails. Since email messages consist of unstructured text, they must be converted into a structured numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms. This is accomplished using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which transforms the email text into feature vectors that reflect the importance of each word relative to the document and the overall collection of emails. TF-IDF helps highlight distinctive words that are more likely to appear in spam or ham emails, improving classification performance.

For classification, the project uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic model well-suited for text classification. Naive Bayes assumes independence between features and calculates the probability that an email belongs to a particular class (spam or ham) based on the observed frequencies of words. This algorithm is favored for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong performance on high-dimensional text data.

The dataset used includes thousands of labeled emails categorized as spam or ham. It is split into training and testing subsets to train the model and evaluate its predictive ability on unseen data. The evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score—provide a comprehensive assessment of how well the classifier identifies spam without mislabeling legitimate emails.

By automating spam detection, this project enhances email management, reduces the risk of phishing attacks, and helps users focus on important communications. The approach combines effective text processing with robust machine learning to deliver a practical solution for everyday email filtering.
